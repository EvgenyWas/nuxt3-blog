Hi there! My name is Yauheni Vasiukevich, and this is my personal project to explore Nuxt 3 capabilities, particularly with Nuxt Content.

The project includes multiple pages with technical articles on various topics, along with user data management features such as personal information, favorite articles and so on. It supports user authentication via email, Google, and GitHub SSO. The rendering mode is SSR and the backend is implemented on top of Nuxt's server utilizing MongoDB Atlas for database management.
